- About The Project.

  In today's digitalized era, everyone wants to come online for better development in terms of wealth and health. Due to enhancement in electronic hardware support and significant increment of desktop and mobile users, a tremendous amount of data had generated every second. And now, with this, responsibility for managing that massive data comes into the picture. As a computer science engineer, our role is to resolve this problem and manage the massive data using our Computer and Logically skills. So, Let's take a problem in Medical Section Domain, as we know every day a lot of patients comes into Medical hospital and receive treatments. During the treatment, the patient moves from different section and departmental clinic of the hospital. And Each department has a patient registry and records maintained as per the clinic norm. But the problem is they maintain records manually or at some places some old version software used by them. To optimize and replace these traditional ways of filling and maintaining the data, we came up with a new system idea. Where we manage, not only the data but also the fewer human involvement will be required. Everyday a large number of patients visit hospitals and clinics to check up; some of them are prescribed to visit next time. Therefore, it is necessary to keep record of patients in all health care organizations. But, the traditional system of storing details of patient is tedious, unsecured and risky. Due to these drawbacks, the development of computerized Patient management system is necessary. Providing quicker and efficient service is the duty of hospitals. But, the time of patient registration is longer than time of treatment in the most hospitals due to use of manual paper-pen system of patient management. The growing use of computers is becoming the solution to these problems these days. The proposed Patient Management System Project is the software to maintain the details of patients in a computerized way. Besides patient management, there are several other features to manage different branches and departments such as pharmacy, hospital employees, doctors, etc.
